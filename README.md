# Code Challenge

## Requirements

* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)

## Setup

* Clone the project and in a terminal run
```
$ composer install
```

* Setup Homestead
```
$ php vendor/bin/homestead make
```

* Start up the vagrant box
```
$ vagrant up
```

* SSH into vagrant
```
$ vagrant ssh
```

* From within the vagrant box change directory and run the migration and seeder 
```
$ cd ~/code
$ php artisan migrate:refresh --seed
```

## The Challenge

This projects inlcudes a migration and seeder that will create a nested set hierarchy. Your goal is to create Restful endpoints to Create, Read, Update and Delete nested set nodes.

## Expectations

Use Eloquent ORM for all interactions with the database. Do not use raw queries.

The Update endpoint must include the ability to move a node to a new parent. If the node has child nodes, it must to also move the child nodes and adjust the Left `lft`, Right `rgt` and Level `level` accordingly.

There shouldn't be gaps in Left or Right, and Level must be accuraty represented.
